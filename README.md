triangletech
============

triangletech aims to become the most comprehensive event calendar for triangle startup and tech meetings. Being in triangle area for 4 years, I always feel the great inconvinience of having to search for events I am interested on tens or hundreds of different websites because there is just not a single website does it for all. I think it will be cool to build such a site with all the triangle startup and tech events available online.  
  
What is already there?  
---  
A calender that user can CRUD events, and a simple but beautiful calendar UI.  
  
What is left to build?  
---  
We need the script to get triangle startup and tech events online (e.g. through meetups API, or weekly web searching on awesome sites like exit event. Please add more things you think we can add by posting an issue.
