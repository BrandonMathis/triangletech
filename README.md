triangletech
============

triangletech is the most comprehensive event calendar for triangle startup and tech meetings. Being in triangle area for 4 years, I always feel the great inconvinience of having to search for events I am interested on tens or hundreds of different websites because there is just not a single website does it for all. I think it will be cool to build such a site with all the triangle startup and tech events available online.  
  
What triangletech have?  
---  
A calender that user can CRUD events, a simple but beautiful calendar UI, and the script to auto discover and add tech/startup events through Meetup and Eventbrite APIs.
